Predicting Electric Scooter Rentals Based on Weather Conditions

This project aims to predict the hourly number of rented electric scooters in an Eastern European city based on weather conditions. The dataset contains rental data and corresponding weather parameters collected over a 10-month period (from December 1, 2022, to September 30, 2023).

The goal is to develop a regression model that identifies the correlation between weather conditions and rental demand, enabling accurate predictions of scooter rentals for the given test period (October 1, 2023 – November 30, 2023).

Various regression techniques can be applied to analyze the relationship between weather factors and rental patterns. Feature selection is flexible, allowing the use of any relevant variables from the dataset to optimize the model’s predictive accuracy.

By leveraging data-driven insights, this project aims to enhance the understanding of how weather influences urban micro-mobility usage, contributing to better demand forecasting and resource allocation.
